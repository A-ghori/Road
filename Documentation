Features

Colored routes based on road condition score

Popup info for each road segment (pothole / traffic / quality)

Multiple routes per start/end point

Scalable to large datasets (10k / 100k segments)

So how it gives Response from backend if user just hit the Road Route from browser inside the backend it proceed like this - Get/ api/getRoutes?modes=bike
Response : {
    "routes": [
        "road_id":"r1",

        "to" :[24,25,26] // another example 
        "pothole_score" : 7,
        "traffic_score":5,
        "quality_score" : 3,
        "score":15,
        "color":"orange"

Suppose this is my Graph Example for more info checkout my diary:-
0-> [1]
1->[0,2,3]
2->[1,3,4]
3->[1,2]
4->[2]

this is my graph and we all know that graph is 4 types -> unidirectional unwighted.
         unidirectional Weighted.
         directional wighted.
         directional unweighted.
